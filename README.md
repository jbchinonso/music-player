# music-player
this is a music player built with pure javascript, html and css

# the idea
the idea behind this app is kind of weird. it intends to player songs directly from the user browser without uploading the song the server.
Currently it works in chrome desktop version.

# progress
work on this project is currently suspended on my side till further notice. However if anyone wishes to contribute to this project it will be highly appreciated.
